# LionCorpLabs 🦁

Welcome to **LionCorpLabs** — a hobby-driven GitHub organization dedicated to creating, maintaining, and sharing **high-quality open source software** for the benefit of the world. **Basically, if you happen to have any weekend fun hobby projects, feel free to release them here!**

## 🌍 Our Mission

At LionCorpLabs, we believe that technology should **empower everyone**, not just those who can afford it. Our mission is to produce robust, secure, and well-engineered software that anyone can use, learn from, and improve — all while protecting the freedom of the community.

We’re committed to:
- Building software that upholds **code quality, reliability, and transparency**.  
- Sharing knowledge and tools for **universal access and benefit**.  
- Preserving **intellectual integrity** through strong copyleft principles.

## ⚖️ Licensing Philosophy

All projects released under LionCorpLabs are licensed with the **GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3**.  

Why AGPLv3?  
Because we believe in **strong network copyleft** — it ensures that when others use or modify our software (even over a network), the improvements remain free and open for everyone to enjoy.  

In short: we give away our work **for free**, but we also safeguard it from proprietary enclosure — maintaining freedom **for all users and developers**.

## 🧠 About the Organization

Although LionCorpLabs is a **hobby project**, it’s run with **professional software practices and standards**. We love experimenting, learning, and solving real problems — always with a focus on making open-source contributions that **stand the test of time**.

Typical areas of contribution:
- Developer tools and frameworks  
- Code quality and security utilities  
- Infrastructure and automation projects  
- Experimental or research-driven software  

## 🤝 Join Us

We welcome passionate developers, tinkerers, and collaborators who share our open-source values.  

If you’d like to contribute or join LionCorpLabs:
- Fork one of our repositories and submit a pull request, **or**

Let’s make a lasting impact — one free piece of software at a time.
